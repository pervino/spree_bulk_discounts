SpreeBulkDiscounts
==================

Bulk Discounts is an extension to Spree (a complete open source commerce solution for Ruby on Rails) that uses predefined breakpoints to determine a discount to apply to a product. For instance, you could offer a 10% discount discount for quantities above 10, and a 20% discount for quantites above 100. By default, the bulk discount will compete with promo adjustments on a line item, with the greater one being applied.

Multiple Bulk Discounts can be setup and assigned to multiple products.


Changes
-------
* Spree::BulkDiscountConfiguration - Contains defaults to override on initialization.

Installation
------------

Add spree_bulk_discounts to your Gemfile:

```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_bulk_discounts:install
